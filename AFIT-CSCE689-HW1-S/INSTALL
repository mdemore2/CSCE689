Code should compile and run straight from the github. It won't do much without your additional code.

Need to install the autotools of automake and autoconf. In a debian-based linux distro (Ubuntu, etc),
should just need to run as superuser (or use sudo):

apt-get install automake
apt-get install autoconf

Then in the homework 1 directory, run autoreconf -i to have it set up the configure script and install the files it needs.

Then run: ./configure to generate the makefiles.

Then run: make
