Homework 1:

Students will use the template code provided on the Github to write a TCP client and server. 
The server should be a single-process non-blocking server that can accept multiple concurrent 
connections and handle user input. When the user first connects, they should receive a list 
of possible commands and what those commands do. These should include

hello - displays a greeting (student's choice)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - displays information to the user (student's choice, but each number should 
provide different info)
passwd - Does nothing yet, but in HW2, will allow them to change their password
exit - disconnects the user
menu - should display the list of available commands in a clean, readable format
Commands not on this list should display an error message.

Recommend creating additional classes for modularity and reusability. Add additional files
to src/Makefile.am and rerun autoreconf and ./configure to integrate support for your new
files.
